# Booguu Website

## Basic Frameworks

### GatsbyJS

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is the main framework used to generates static HTML files from React templates and Markdown text files.

### gatsby-transformer-remark

This [plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/) used to generate HTML files from Markdown files.

### Netlify CMS

[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/intro/) provides a friendly UI for a Git-based content management workflow.  This allows editors to work with this CMS system without having directly work with Markdown formatted files and the underlying Git repository.


## Development Process

Developers need to create a feature branch off `master` using a branch name with the format `feature/<name>`, where `<name>` is a short name for the feature, project or engagement.  For example: `feature/initial-template` or `feature/ui-template-2020-03`

The feature branch should be pushed to the origin Git repository for collaboration, code reviews, etc.  Upon completion of the work, create a merge request for final review and acceptance.


## Development Environment

1.  This project runs under NodeJS 12.  This must be installed or use Docker.

1.  To setup local environment, install all necessary packages:

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

1.  To start the local server for development:

    ```shell
    npm start
    ```

    This will run two services on port 3000 and 3001 on the `localhost`.

1.  To access the website:  `http://localhost:3000/`

1.  To access Netlify CMS:  `http://localhost:3000/admin/`


## Source files

1.  **`src/pages`**

    Templates for static webpages (those not backed by specific Markdown files).  Templates in this directory usually needs to be locale-specific.

1.  **`src/components`**

    Reusable React components that can be used by any template.

1.  **`src/templates`**

    Templates used to generate pages from Markdown files.  The `templateKey` in each Markdown file will be used to determine which template file to use.  All possible `templateKey` values must have a corresponding template JS file within this directory or the development server/build process will not run.

1.  **`src/locales`**

    Localization files.

1.  **`src/images`**

    Image files used by templates.

1.  **`gatsby-*.js`**

    GatsbyJS configuration files.

1.  **`static/admin/config.yml`**

    Netlify CMS configuration file.


## Data files (generated by users/editors)

1.  **`static/media`**

    Files (e.g. images) uploaded by users via Netlify CMS.

1.  **`content`**

    Markdown files created via Netlify CMS.



## Other Notes

1.  Templates are generally located in `src/pages` and `src/components`.  For `pages`, there **MUST** be a template for each supported locale.  Unfortunately, we have not figured out how to get the `gatsby-plugin-i18n` plugin to use a default (locale-neutral) page template when a locale-specific one is not available.

    The `https://github.com/wiziple/gatsby-plugin-intl` will automatically use a single template for different locale-specific URLs.  However, it does not allow for locale-specific templates!

### üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

### üéì Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
